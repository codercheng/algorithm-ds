##描述
```
Given a binary tree, a target node in the binary tree, and an integer value k,print all the nodes that are at distance k from the given target node. No parent pointers are available.
```

##例子
![tree](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/BinaryTree4.png)

```
Consider the tree shown in diagram
Input: target = pointer to node with data 8. 
       root = pointer to node with data 20.
       k = 2.
Output : 10 14 22

If target is 14 and k is 3, then output 
should be "4 20"
```
